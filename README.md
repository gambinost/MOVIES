# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This is a demo project that recommends movies using a combination of **AI (KNN algorithm)**, **Python**, and **Flutter**. 

---

## Project Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask API)
- **Communication**: HTTP requests between Flutter and Flask
- **Machine Learning**: KNN-based movie recommendations

---

##  Features

### ✅ Current Features
- Clean UI built with Flutter
- Sends movie name input from the app to Flask
- Returns movie recommendations using KNN
- Recommend top movies based on Genre

---

##  AI & Data Processing

- Uses **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to recommend similar movies.
- The dataset is **cleaned and preprocessed**:
  - Handled missing values
  - Encoded features as needed
  - Optimized for recommendation logic

---

## 🛠 Planned Features

-  **Advanced search** using NLP or semantic techniques
-  **Live movie data** from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
-  **Enhanced UI layout** with grid-style movie display
-  **Backend deployment** (Render, Railway, or FastAPI) so the API runs continuously without needing to start `app.py` manually
